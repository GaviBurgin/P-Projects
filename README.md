# P-Projects

This repository is for my **real-world quantitative projects**, focused on exploring finance and financial engineering under the real-world measure (P). These projects reflect actual probabilities based on historical data and incorporating investor preferences. I will cover areas such as portfolio optimization, market analysis, and risk management. As I gain experience, I'll continue adding projects in finance and related fields.
