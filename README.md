# P-Projects

This repository is for my **real-world quantitative projects**, focused on using the real-world measure (P) to address practical finance problems. These projects reflect actual probabilities based on historical data and incorporating investor preferences. I aim to explore areas such as portfolio optimization, market analysis, and risk management. As I gain experience, I'll continue adding projects that tackle pressing challenges in finance and related fields.
